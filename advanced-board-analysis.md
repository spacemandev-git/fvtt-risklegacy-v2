# Advanced Board Territory Analysis

## Methodology
Systematically examining assets/board/advanced.jpg to identify:
1. All territory names (from labels)
2. Territory colors/continent assignments
3. Border adjacencies

## Color Zones Observed

### Yellow Zone (appears to be western North America)
- Alaska
- Western United States
- Eastern United States

### Light Green Zone (northern/central North America)
- Northwest Territory
- Ontario
- Quebec (?)

### Grey Zone (appears neutral/special)
- Alberta (grey territory in Canada)

### Teal/Cyan Zone (Arctic/northern)
- Greenland

### Light Blue/Grey Zone (Europe)
- Iceland
- Great Britain
- Scandinavia
- Northern Europe
- Western Europe
- Southern Europe

### Dark Blue Zone (appears to be northern Asia/Russia)
- Russia
- Siberia (?)

### Orange Zone (South America)
- Central America
- Venezuela
- Peru
- Brazil
- Argentina

### Brown Zone (Africa)
- North Africa
- Egypt
- East Africa
- Congo (?)
- South Africa
- Madagascar (?)

### Light Green Zone (western/central Asia)
- Ural
- Yakutsk
- Kamchatka
- Afghanistan
- Middle East
- India

### Green Zone (central/eastern Asia)
- Irkutsk
- Siam

### Pink/Magenta Zone (central Asia)
- Mongolia
- China

### Dark Purple Zone (Australia/Southeast Asia)
- Indonesia
- New Guinea
- Western Australia
- Eastern Australia

## Questions/Uncertainties
1. Is Alberta truly a separate grey zone or just shading?
2. What are the exact continent groupings?
3. Some territory boundaries are hard to distinguish

## Next Steps
- Trace each territory's borders to determine adjacencies
- Determine if this board has more than 6 continents
- Map all connections systematically
