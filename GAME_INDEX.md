## Game Phases

### Setup Phase
1. **Faction Selection**: Players choose factions (order determined by recent game performance)
2. **Power Selection**: Each player picks 1 of their faction's 2 starting powers
3. **Initial Placement**: Players place starting troops and HQs based on draft order
4. **Territory Card Distribution**: Unused territories placed in draw deck

### Turn Structure
Each player's turn consists of:

1. **Recruit Troops**
   - Count controlled territories + population (cities)
   - Divide by 3, round down (Balkania rounds up)
   - Minimum 3 troops
   - OR turn in resource cards for bonus troops

2. **Attacking** (optional)
   - Attack from territory with 2+ troops to adjacent enemy territory
   - Attacker rolls 1-3 dice (based on attacking troops)
   - Defender rolls 1-2 dice (based on defending troops)
   - Highest die wins, defender wins ties
   - Continue until attacker stops or conquers territory

3. **Maneuver** (optional, once per turn)
   - Move troops between connected friendly territories
   - Saharan Republic can move between any territories

4. **Draw Resource Card** (if conquered at least 1 territory from an opponent)
   - Look at face-up Territory cards on sideboard
   - If you control a territory shown, you must draw that card
   - If you can't draw any shown territory, draw a face-up Coin card
   - Balkania special: Draw coin card when expanding 4+ without conquest

### Win Conditions
- **First to 4 Red Star tokens wins immediately**
- Red Star tokens (the victory points) can be earned by:
  - Conquering a territory with an opponent's HQ (1 token)
  - Completing a mission card objective (1-2 tokens as noted on card)
  - Winning the game (awards Red Star tokens based on campaign state)

Note: "Red Stars" are victory point tokens that players earn, not markers on territories

### End Game
- Winner signs the board
- Winner places victory sticker (bonus for that territory in future games)
- All players can add to scar deck (permanent faction penalties)
- Check for unlock conditions and open new packs if triggered

## Legacy/Campaign Mechanics

### Unlock Packs

5. **Eliminated Pack** - When faction eliminated from a game

Each pack contains:

### Persistent Game State
Between games, the following persists:
- Board signatures and date stamps
- City locations and names
- Territory scars and modifications
- Resource card values (can increase from 1 to 4)
- Unlocked content (cards, powers, rules)
- Faction scars (negative abilities)
- Starting positions/advantages from previous wins

## Combat System

### Basic Combat
- **Attacker**: Rolls 1-3 dice (1 per troop, max 3)
- **Defender**: Rolls 1-2 dice (1 per troop, max 2)
- Compare highest die: ties go to defender
- If 2+ dice each, compare second highest too
- Loser removes 1 troop per lost comparison

### Combat Modifiers
- **Fortified Territory**: Defender gets +1 to highest die
- **Missiles**: Can be used once to modify a single die
- **Faction Powers**: Various combat bonuses/penalties
- **Territory Scars**: May affect combat in specific territories

### Dice Rules
- Natural 6s and 3-of-a-kind have special effects (faction dependent)
- Some powers trigger on specific roll combinations
- Missiles are permanent when used (placed on board)

## Special Mechanics

### HQ (Headquarters)
- Counts as 1 troop for combat
- When conquered, gives attacker 1 star
- Can be placed in any controlled territory with no HQ
- Some factions get bonuses for HQ placement

### Cities
- **Minor Cities**: Provide +1 population for recruitment
- **World Capital**: Provides +1 to ALL resource cards in that continent
- Cities are founded by placing city stickers on territories
- Limited supply (9 minor, 1 world capital)

### Resource Cards
- Start with value of 1
- Can be increased with stickers (max 4)
- Turn in sets for troops:
  - 3 cards same territory: 4 troops
  - 1 card from each of 3 continents: 8 troops
  - 3+ matching values: troops = (4 × value)

### Missions
- Dealt at start of game (keep secret)
- Complete objective for 1 star
- Objectives vary: control continents, eliminate players, control specific territories
- Can discard mission once per game to draw new one

## Game Variants
The rules mention two board variants:
1. **Original** - Standard Risk Legacy board
2. **Advanced** - Modified board layout (unlocked later)

## Key Strategic Elements

### Turn Order
- First game: random
- Subsequent games: Players with fewer stars go first
- Creates catchup mechanic

### Faction Evolution
- Factions start relatively balanced
- Gain unique advantages through signed board bonuses
- Accumulate scars as penalties
- Unlock additional powers through campaign

### Risk vs Reward
- Aggressive play earns stars but creates enemies
- Conservative play safer but slower
- Unlocking new content requires meeting specific conditions
- Permanent choices (naming, placement) affect all future games
